The file /proc/uptime virtually contains how long has be machine been running.
When I print the contents of the file (`cat proc/time`) I get two floating point numbers.

As described in the manpages the command cut removes section of each line in a specified file.
 → the argument -d is used to specify delimeter which we have set to ' '
 → the -f argument followed by a number selcts an item

Therefore the command takes the one and only line of /proc/uptime separates it by the ' ' character
 and then selects the first number.
